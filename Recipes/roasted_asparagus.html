    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p>Fresh asparagus spears are simply seasoned with garlic, topped with shredded Parmesan cheese, and baked until tender and sweet in this easy spring side dish.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>Oil:</strong> This recipe calls for olive oil cooking spray, but you can easily grease your casserole dish with regular ol' olive oil.</li>
        <li><strong>Asparagus:</strong> Buy plump, firm asparagus stalks with tightly closed tips. The color should be vibrant and unfaded, while the stalks should be roughly the same size for even cooking.</li>
        <li><strong>Parmesan:</strong> Freshly grated Parmesan cheese is best, but pre-shredded will work in a pinch.</li>
        <li><strong>Sea Salt:</strong> Opt for a coarse sea salt for the best results. Kosher salt will work if that's all you have on hand.</li>
        <li><strong>Garlic Powder:</strong> Just a pinch of garlic powder adds bold, herbaceous flavor to this Parmesan-topped roasted asparagus.</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Preheat oven to 400 degrees F (200 degrees C).</li>
        <li>Spray the inside of a 9x13 casserole dish with olive oil cooking spray. Place asparagus in the dish and lightly spray spears with cooking spray.</li>
        <li>Sprinkle asparagus with Parmesan cheese, sea salt, and garlic powder.</li>
        <li>Roast in preheated oven until fork easily punctures thickest part of stem, about 12 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
